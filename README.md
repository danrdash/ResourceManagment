Used multiple threads inorder to count all primitive pythagorean triplets given a positive natural integer

```
from wikipedia
A Pythagorean triple is a set of three positive integers a, b, and chaving the property that they can be respectively the two legs
and the hypotenuse of a right triangle, thus satisfying the equation {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2};
the triple is said to be primitive if and only if a, b, and c share no common divisor. Note that this implies that a, b, and c
are also pairwise coprime. The set of all primitive Pythagorean triples has the structure of a rooted tree, specifically a ternary
tree, in a natural way. This was first discovered by B. Berggren in 1934.[1]
