Used multiple threads inorder to calculate all primitive pythagorean triplets(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_primitive_Pythagorean_triples) given a positive natural integer
all pythagorean triples are calculated in parallel, a Producer-Consumer problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem) is solved using semaphores and mutexes inorder to create mutual exclusion.
